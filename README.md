# SBMANet

We use the nnUNetv2 framework, you can download for the website: https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet. 

The above files except for nnUNetTrainer.py are put into the fold:nnunetv2\training\nnUNetTrainer\variants\network_architecture.

In the meanwhile, you replace the nnUNetTrainer class file with uploaded file named as 'nnUNetTrainer.py.
